    <p>The Graphic Design program encourages students to be innovative while emphasizing strong technical skills. Students can explore a synthesis of corporate, expressive and experimental graphic design processes, among them drawing and scanning, Process Dissection Trees, Analog Photocopy Layering process, "drawing with images", and drawing and illustration as design. The program is a combination of Handcraft and digital processes, where students receive personal, hands-on instruction. This program treats graphic design as a branch of the fine arts.	</p>
